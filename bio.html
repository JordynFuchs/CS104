She is an architecture major and is in the five-year degree and certification program. She found her way to architecture through the arts, seeking a field that would let her design and work creatively. She has an extensive background in the arts that spans from traditional drawing to layered three-dimensional art pieces, and many mediums in between. She also has considerable education in engineering, having completed the four-year PLTW program during her high school career, which gave her experience in CAD and technical drawing as well.
