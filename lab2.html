        <p style="color:cadetblue">Jordyn Fuchs is a first year student in the New Jersey Institute of Technology, and is part of both the Hillier College of Art and Design and the Albert Dorman Honors College. She is an architecture major and is in the five-year degree and certification program. She found her way to architecture through the arts, seeking a field that would let her design and work creatively. She has an extensive background in the arts that spans from traditional drawing to layered three-dimensional art pieces, and many mediums in between. She also has considerable education in engineering, having completed the four-year PLTW program during her high school career, which gave her experience in CAD and technical drawing as well.
